                <h3 class="yellow">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Bill Nye The Science Guy discovered this animal while on vacation in Sanya, Hainan, in October 2023. He was confused by the weird color of the bee, which was red and black. The bee watched Bill for three full weeks while he was on vacation, and one day a snake tried attacking Bill. The bee shifted into its red and black color and scared away the snake.

                <p>
                    The devil bee is part of the apidae family, but it is a bit different compared to other bees in this family. The devil bee likes flowers and plants, but doesn't pollinate them like other bees do.

                <h3 class="yellow">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>The devil bee likes to live in typically sunny places with lots of green. It likes to fly in the clouds and occasionally come down to see the flowers, but it is rare to see one near the ground.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>
                    The devil bee is normally red and yellow, and it has very sharp wings. From certain angles, the bee's wings look like horns, and it uses this to scare off predators. It will show its black color to anyone that it feels emotionally safe around.

                The Devil Bee is hard to spot when it is in its normal color variant, as it can blend in with normal bees. The unique aspects of the devil bee include its ability to change colors and have its wings pointed up at will to intimidate potential predators. The devil bee possesses good survival skills with its night vision as well as its defensive mechanisms.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> The devil bee is defensive and hard to get close to. It will tend to watch humans or animals and slowly gain trust with time. In this interaction, press "b" and "y" to toggle between the different colors of the devil bee. Then use "y" and "x" to fly the bees through the rough wind. The bee2 has a damaged wing, so no matter how hard it tries to fly sometimes, it can't really take off the same way that bee1 flies.
